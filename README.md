## 🧭 Overview

**RPM (Remote Process Monitor)** is a real-time process monitoring tool built
for QNX systems. It consists of a lightweight server that runs on a
Raspberry Pi and a web-based dashboard that visualizes live process data.

The dashboard connects to the server over WebSockets, enabling low-latency,
real-time updates on system performance and process activity.

> **Note:** This repository contains only the **web application frontend**.
